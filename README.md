# Mobile Kotlin multiplatform project template

This project is part of a study of Kotlin's multi-platform functionality, which reviews its advantages and limitations, as well as its current status. 

Here I exemplify the migration of an Android project to multi-platform, measuring the costs and benefits of it, so that it can be used as support for real projects and help guide others in the decision of using Kotlin multi-platform.

This project does not intend to be a guide of the functionalities available in Kotlin multi-platform, but an analysis where its possibilities are defined and the situations in which it can be most useful are reflected.

The Android project from which the migration was made can be found here: https://github.com/Jaime97/likeAStarApp
